# Airbnb New User Bookings

- Where will anew guest book their first travel experience?

- The Kaggle [Airbnb New User Bookings](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/overview) dataset contains information about users who have signed up for Airbnb and is focused on predicting where a new user will book their first travel experience. more info in the link

___
## **Description**
With the use of travel destination predictions and personalized booking recommendations, this project aims to streamline the booking process for new users of the Airbnb site.

___
## **Requirements**
- [**Sklearn**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) (scikit-learn (sklearn) is a popular Python library for machine learning that provides a wide range of tools)
- **numpy**/**pandas**
- **[streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/)** (Streamlit is a Python library that allows you to create interactive web-based applications for machine learning and data science.)
- **[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html)** (Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.)
- **[plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)** (is a data visualization library that allows you to create interactive plots and graphs.)
- **[skforecast](https://joaquinamatrodrigo.github.io/skforecast/0.4.3/index.html)** ( is a *python* library that eases using scikit-learn regressors as multi-step forecasters.)

## **Pre-Processing**
* Handling categorical data
* handling time series data
* handling missing data
* feature engineering

more about it [here](https://andrew2077-airbnb-model--airbnb-cpucud.streamlit.app)

___
## **Guideline**  

1. just visit our deployed model with the documentation [here](https://andrew2077-airbnb-model--airbnb-cpucud.streamlit.app)

1. otherwise if you wish to run it locally just run '✈️_Airbnb.py' with the instruction below in terminal
   >streamlit run ✈️_Airbnb.py

___

## **Results**

- used 3 Algorithm 
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- used differnt filling values techniques that altered model accuracy slightly 
- playalong with the model [here](https://andrew2077-airbnb-model--airbnb-cpucud.streamlit.app/Visualizor)
  - just Enable the model Aaccuracy checkbosx 
___

## **Future Work**

- [ ] add more models
- [ ] use more filling values techniques
- [ ] add more visualizations
